If you are non-exclusive you can continue to source 
and acquire sponsorships externally and we will include

         <p className='text-left font-light text-xs md:text-tiny flex justify-center'>If you are exclusive, you’ll be assigned your own personal
manager who will work closely with you to source sponsors 
with brands you would like to work with. For example, if you 
wanted a fashion edit with a brand, we would help acquire 
this for you. You’ll also be assigned your own RBI email address 
and we would handle all of your email enquires on your behalf.

        </div>

         <p className='text-left font-light text-xs md:text-tiny flex justify-center'>Our exclusive contracts start at a minimum term of 
6 months. This gives you the chance to see how we can 
work with you without having to commit to a full year 
(many agencies require a full year contract). If you felt 
after this 6 month period that you would rather be 
non-exclusive then you’d be able to change to the 
non-exclusive option after 6 months. You’ll be provided 
with your own RBI email address that would be listed as 
a ‘business contact’ on your social media accounts.

         <p className='text-left font-light text-xs md:text-tiny flex justify-center'>We handle all payments on your behalf. Payment timeline
is approximately 45-60 days after your content goes live. This
varies from brand to brand but you’ll be advised at the time of
sponsorship offer the exact payment timeline for the specific
collaboration. Once received from the client, you’ll be notified 
that your payment is being processed and from there it’ll take
1-3 days to show in your bank account. We normally send 
payments via bank account but we can accomodate PayPal
or Wise payments if preferred.
